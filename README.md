Photo Gallery to share sisters' artwork

## Milestone 1 Feedback
This is a great direction for your PWP, and we've had a number of students create wonderful art gallery projects. I do want you to be aware that these kind of projects do have some potential added challenges however.

Although a project like this has great potential for expansion, keep in mind the very narrow scope of PWP relative to an idea such as this. Also, because your PWP will be a project for an actual client, hopefully you'll have the benefit of having some real data and information available to base the design phase and content strategy on. Ideally the Persona you created would be throroughly representative of the primary target audience and market demographic for your client's/artist's website. 

Working with images can sometimes present a challenge if you're not already well versed in digital image editing or graphic design. I can help with some standards, practices, and recommendations for working with image assets when the time comes. Let's talk after Milestone 2a, when you're ready to begin development.

I also recommend limiting the number of gallery items to a number that is reasonable for a single scrolling web page. Although pagination of gallery items is an option, I'm going to advise against it at this time for reasons of potential complexity and an increase in your development time. I generally always advise in favor of simplicity for our class projects.

Nice work. I'm really looking forward to seeing this project take shape. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Move your `/images` directory inside `/documentation`. This will keep your Milestone documentation images isolated from the rest of your project going forward.
