			<p>The mobile photo gallery will have a drop down navigation menu inside the page header. These links will take you to different categories of artwork (i.e., "Dragons" will take you back to the dragons section if you have scrolled past it to see some of the other artwork).</p>
			<p>Each section will only contain two or three visible pieces at a time. You may scroll left and right to see other pictures in that section.</p>
			<p>When a picture is "clicked" or selected, a light box will expand to fill most of the screen giving you an enlarged version of the image. This will be accompanied by a brief description of the piece under the image.</p>
		</div>

			<img src="../../images/pwp-desktop-wireframe1.png" alt="Photo Gallery Desktop Main"/>
			<p>The desktop version of the site contain a header that may have a quote or brief description regarding the artists inspiration (mini bio).
			<p>There will be an aside that will be made of a navigation bar. The links inside the bar will be anchored to different sections on the page. This will allow a user to navigate back to a section of artwork if they have scrolled by it or want ot move to it quickly.</p>
			<p>Within the main part of the page, each section of artwork will be able to display 4 or 5 images at once, from left to right and may wrap underneath.</p>
			<p>The footer will contain copyright or some sort of "Property Of" information as well as links to any social media sites.</p>

			<p>When an image is "clicked" a light box will fill the majority of the desktop screen with a high resolution image of the artwork. Attached to it will be a brief description of the piece.</p>
			<p>While an image is expanded, the user may scroll left and right to see other images in the same section.</p>
